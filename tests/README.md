# Pytest Tests
Before running the tests, make sure that the config file contains an entry for `contact_type`
```python
VOCABS = {
    'contact_type': {
        'source': VocabSource.File,
        'title': 'Contact Type (file)'
    }
}
``` 

To run the tests, simply type `pytest <path-to-test-directory>` in your virtualenv. 

See [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for more information.
